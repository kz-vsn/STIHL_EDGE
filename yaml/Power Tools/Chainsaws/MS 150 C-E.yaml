    description: >-
        The STIHL MS 150 C-E is a lightweight dynamo, weighing only
        6.1 pounds and loaded with exclusive STIHL features,
        including Easy2Start&trade; technology. Ideal for
        landscapers, arborists, tree farmers, or anyone in
        need of a mobile, low weight saw, the MS 150 C-E
        chainsaw is easy to handle, resulting in less
        operator fatigue than heavier saws. Combined with
        reduced exhaust emissions and enhanced fuel
        efficiency as compared to traditional 2-stroke
        engines, this is how ultra-lightweight chainsaws
        should be made: the STIHL way.
