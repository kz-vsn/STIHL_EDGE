        The STIHL MS 193 C-E chainsaw features compact design and
        advanced engine technology, giving it one of the
        best power-to-weight ratios in its class. This
        homeowner saw delivers professional-grade durability
        and easy handling &ndash; use it for storm cleanup,
        tree pruning or firewood cutting. The powerful
        engine offers improved fuel efficiency and reduced
        exhaust emissions*. Other features of the MS 193 C-E
        include a purge pump primer, which reduces the
        likelihood of flooding the engine, and STIHL
        Easy2Start&trade; for reduced effort while starting.
        *A majority of STIHL powerheads are built in the
        United States from domestic and foreign parts and
        components. Reduced fuel costs and emissions are as
        compared to MS 192 C-E .
