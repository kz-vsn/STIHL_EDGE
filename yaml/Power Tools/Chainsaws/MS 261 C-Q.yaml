    description: >-
        Reducing emissions by 50% and increasing fuel efficiency up
        to 20% as compared to previous models, the STIHL MS
        261 C-Q chainsaw can minimize environmental impact
        and allow longer periods of use between refueling.
        Ideal for felling, thinning, firewood cutting and
        clearing, the MS 261 C-Q chainsaw features several
        operator-friendly components, including an advanced
        anti-vibration system that reduces user fatigue, a
        side-access chain tensioner, a translucent fuel
        tank, and toolless fuel and oil caps with retainers.
        The MS 261 C-Q also includes STIHL Quickstop&reg;
        Plus, an additional chain braking feature designed
        to stop the chain in less than one second of
        releasing the rear handle.
