    description: >-
        A &ldquo;must have&rdquo;&mdash; this mid-range chainsaw
        works hard in the woodpile and is designed
        specifically for cutting firewood around the farm,
        ranch or in the woods. With a high power-to-weight
        ratio, the MS 270 has a long slim body, making it
        comfortable for larger users. For use with a 16 to
        20 inch bar, its sleek design and advanced anti-
        vibration system make it an all around excellent
        mid-range chainsaw.
