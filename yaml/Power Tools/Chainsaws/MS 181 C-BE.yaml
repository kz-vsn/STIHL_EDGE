        The MS 181 C-BE Chainsaw features Easy2Start&trade; and
        allows an easier start that requires less pulling
        force. The Quick Chain Adjuster makes adjusting and
        removing saw chains simple &ndash; no tools are
        needed. Reduced vibrations lessen user fatigue
        making this tool ideal for landscaping jobs around
        the home. Because of its reduced-emission engine
        technology, the MS 181 C-BE lowers fuel consumption
        and requires less air filter maintenance.
