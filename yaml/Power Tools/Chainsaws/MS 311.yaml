    description: >-
        Ideal for felling, firewood cutting and storm cleanup, this
        mid-range chainsaw features a low-emission engine
        that reduces fuel consumption by up to 10% compared
        to previous models. The new air filtration system
        requires fewer filter changes and allows for longer
        run times.
