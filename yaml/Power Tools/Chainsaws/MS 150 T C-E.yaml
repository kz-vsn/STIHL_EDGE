        Exclusively for in-tree professionals, the STIHL MS 150 T
        C-E features durability and portability. This
        lightweight powerhead weighs only 5.7 pounds and
        features Easy2Start&trade; technology for smooth
        starts. Ideal for arborists, the MS 150 T C-E is
        easy to carry, and its top-handle design is easy to
        maneuver. The result is less operator fatigue, which
        can result from use of heavier saws. It also
        features reduced exhaust emission technology and
        enhanced fuel efficiency as compared to traditional
        2-stroke engines, which means fewer fill-ups and
        fewer interruptions to your work. This is how STIHL
        makes ultra-lightweight chainsaws: The right way.
