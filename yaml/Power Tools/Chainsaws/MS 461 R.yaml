    description: >-
        The STIHL MS 461 R is a great all-around professional
        forestry and tree care chainsaw. With the same power
        and weight as the MS 460, it offers up to 20% less
        fuel consumption, meaning you can spend less time
        refueling and less money on fuel. This durable
        chainsaw also features a wrap-around handle for use
        in multiple positions for felling or limbing with
        hands in the proper positions. The heavy-duty HD-2
        filter element provides longer run times between air
        filter maintenance. The MS 461 R is also available
        in a non-wrap handle version.
