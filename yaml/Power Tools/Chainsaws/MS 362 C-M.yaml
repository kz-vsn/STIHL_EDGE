    description: >-
        The MS 362 C-MQ features the same great power, weight and
        fuel efficiency as the MS 362, but also features our
        exclusive STIHL M-Tronic&trade; engine management
        technology. This innovative microprocessor-
        controlled engine management system optimizes engine
        performance and compensates for changes in operating
        conditions, such as temperature, elevation, fuel
        quality &ndash; including octane levels, and dirty
        air filters.
