    description: >-
        The MS 261 C-MQ has all the same great features as the MS
        261 &ndash; low emissions, high fuel efficiency and
        performance &ndash; for professional users and
        homeowners with large jobs. The MS 261 C-MQ also
        includes advanced STIHL M-Tronic&trade; engine
        management system. With STIHL M-Tronic&trade; an
        onboard microprocessor digitally monitors and
        automatically compensates for changes in your work
        conditions including elevation, temperature, fuel
        quality, varying octane levels and dirty air
        filters. The end result is maximum performance
        across a wide range of cutting conditions without
        making any manual adjustments. The saw also features
        STIHL Quickstop&reg; Plus, an additional chain
        braking feature designed to stop the chain in less
        than one second when you completely release the rear
        handle.
