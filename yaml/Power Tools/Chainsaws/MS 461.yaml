    description: >-
        With the same power and weight as the MS 460, it offers up
        to 20% less fuel consumption, meaning you can spend
        less time refueling and less money on fuel. This
        durable chainsaw also features high torque over a
        broad RPM range to deliver professional performance.
        The heavy-duty HD-2 filter element provides longer
        run times between air filter maintenance. Wrap
        handle (MS 461 R) and severe cold weather (VW)
        versions are also available.
