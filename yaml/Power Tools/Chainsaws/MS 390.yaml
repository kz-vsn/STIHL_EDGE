    description: >-
        Series 1127 Mid-Range Use The MS 390 is not for the faint
        hearted. With even more engine power than the MS
        310, this chainsaw commands your attention. Most
        popular for farming or firewood cutting, it is our
        top model of mid-range saws. Capable of cutting
        through large logs and flushing stumps, itâ€™s also
        fitted with a decompression valve for easier
        starting and a combination of performance features
        that make each job go a little faster.
