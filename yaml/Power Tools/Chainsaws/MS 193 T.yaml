        The MS 193 T is affordably priced and packed with premium
        features that save time and money. The compact, top-
        handled design, low weight, and superior power-to-
        weight ratio makes it a top choice for tree service
        personnel and arborists who are looking for
        performance in a tool that is easy to handle, and
        reduces operator fatigue. Ideal for storm cleanup,
        and tree pruning, it offers additional features like
        a toolless retainer for the air filter cover, a
        lanyard ring, purge pump primer, and the
        IntelliCarb&trade; Compensating Carburetor. This
        product is proudly built in America* and engineered
        to offer demanding professionals affordable and
        cost-efficient performance. *A majority of STIHL
        powerheads are built in the United States from
        domestic and foreign parts and components. Reduced
        fuel costs and emissions as compared to the previous
        model (MS 192 T).
