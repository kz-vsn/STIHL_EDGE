    description: >-
        With low-emission, fuel-efficient engine technology, the
        STIHL MS 362 professional chainsaw is engineered to
        save you time and money. Use up to 20% less fuel
        compared to previous models, and with the new pre-
        separation air filtration system, you&rsquo;ll have
        fewer filter changes and longer run times. The
        advanced anti-vibration system allows you to keep
        working comfortably for longer periods of use during
        most applications, including logging, thinning,
        arborwork and large woodcutting jobs. All this, plus
        70 percent lower emissions compared to previous
        models, makes the MS 362 an ideal choice for
        professionals and serious users. As part of a new
        platform design concept, the MS 362 allows for
        quicker, more streamlined serviceability from your
        local STIHL Dealer.
