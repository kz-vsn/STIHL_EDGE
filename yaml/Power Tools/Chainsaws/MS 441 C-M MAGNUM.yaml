    description: >-
        Featuring STIHL M-Tronic&trade; &ndash; an engine management
        control system that intelligently manages the
        operating performance of the engine &ndash; the MS
        441 C-M MAGNUM&reg; chainsaw is ideal for
        professional jobs. The innovative system eliminates
        the low and high-speed carburetor adjustment screws
        and compensates for dirty air filters, changes in
        elevation and fuel quality through an electronic
        monitoring of the engine, digitally controlling the
        fuel/air mixture. Designed with the professional in
        mind, the MS 441 C-M MAGNUM&reg; features a side-
        access chain tensioner and an advanced anti-
        vibration system that helps reduce user fatigue. A
        translucent fuel tank makes checking levels easy. A
        decompression valve and pre-separation air
        filtration offer an easier start and longer run
        times.
