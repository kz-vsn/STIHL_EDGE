    description: >-
        For in-tree professional use only! Designed for arborists
        and tree trimming professionals, the STIHL MS 201 T
        Chainsaw uses advanced engine technology to reduce
        engine emissions by a remarkable 70%. Plus, a 20%
        increase in fuel economy means longer run times
        between refueling. In addition, its built-in harness
        ring provides balanced distribution of chainsaw
        weight during in-tree use. Reduced vibration,
        improved ergonomics and a top-handle design help
        reduce operator fatigue, and the Master Control
        Lever&trade; provides easier starting, operating and
        stopping.
