    description: >-
        Equipped with the Easy2Start&trade; system and a quick chain
        adjuster, the MS 291 C-BEQ reduces the strength
        needed to start the engine and allows the user to
        adjust saw chain tension without the use of tools.
        The low-emission and fuel-efficient engine increases
        run time between refueling by 20% over the previous
        model and reduces fuel consumption. But don&rsquo;t
        let that fool you, the MS 291 C-BEQ packs plenty of
        power for felling, firewood cutting and storm
        cleanup. The additional chain braking feature is
        designed to help reduce the risk of injury. This
        mid-range, operator-friendly chainsaw is an
        excellent choice.
