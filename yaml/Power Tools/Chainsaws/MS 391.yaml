    description: >-
        With an advanced low-emission engine technology, the STIHL
        MS 391 mid-range chainsaw improves fuel efficiency
        by up to 20% compared to previous models. The new
        air filtration system requires fewer filter changes,
        allowing for longer run times. Improved fuel
        efficiency and fewer filter changes save you time
        and money.
