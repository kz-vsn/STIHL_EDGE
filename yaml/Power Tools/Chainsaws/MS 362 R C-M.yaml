    description: >-
        This STIHL MS 362 R professional chainsaw features include
        an enhanced low-emission engine technology with up
        to 20% less fuel consumption than previous models.
        Improved air filtration means fewer filter changes
        and longer runtimes. The MS 362 R is a great choice
        for logging, thinning, arborwork and large
        woodcutting jobs.
