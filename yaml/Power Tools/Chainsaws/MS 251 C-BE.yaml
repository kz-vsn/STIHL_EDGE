        The STIHL MS 251 C-BE Chainsaw is as powerful and fuel-
        efficient as the MS 251, but is also easy to start
        and adjust. Ergonomically designed to bring you
        maximum comfort during use, this tool produces 50
        percent less emissions (as compared to previous
        models) for a smaller impact on the environment. The
        MS 251 C-BE packs features like Easy2Start&trade;
        technology and easy-to-refill fuel and oil tanks, so
        you can worry less about starting and operating your
        equipment, and have more time getting your outdoor
        jobs done. And with its Quick Chain Adjuster, you
        can make sure you have proper tension on your saw
        chain without the need of additional tools.
