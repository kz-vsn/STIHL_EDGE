    description: >-
        For greater maneuverability when felling large trees, turn
        to the impressive performance of the MS 661 R C-M.
        Its wrap-around handle also provides greater
        operator comfort when cutting. Just like the MS 661
        C-M, the saw includes STIHL M-Tronic&trade; engine
        monitoring technology and delivers less vibration
        and 20% greater fuel efficiency than the MS 660.
        Other features include long-life filter system using
        HD-2 filter elements to provide longer run times
        between maintenance, an ElastoStart&trade; handle
        and a high output adjustable oiler. (Wrap-handle
        version is available in select areas only).
