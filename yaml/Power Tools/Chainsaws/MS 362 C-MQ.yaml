    description: >-
        The MS 362 C-MQ features the same great power, weight and
        fuel efficiency as the MS 362, but also features our
        exclusive STIHL M-Tronic&trade; engine monitoring
        technology. STIHL M-Tronic&trade; digitally monitors
        and automatically compensates for changes in
        elevation, temperature, fuel quality &ndash;
        including octane levels, and dirty air filters. The
        MS 362 C-MQ also features STIHL Quickstop&reg; Plus
        designed to stop the chain in one second when you
        completely release your right hand from the rear
        handle.
