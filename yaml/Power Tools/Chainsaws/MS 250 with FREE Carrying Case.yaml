        Series 1123 Occasional Use Reserve an MS 250 and receive a
        Free Carrying Case. Offer good from 8/1/11 - 9/30/11
        at participating Dealers while supplies last. A step
        up from the MS 230, the MS 250 is light enough to
        move through smaller tasks like clearing or cleanup
        but packs a powerful enough punch to cut through
        small limbs and trees. A combination of features and
        a high power-to-weight ratio makes this one of the
        best homeowner chainsaws on the market.
