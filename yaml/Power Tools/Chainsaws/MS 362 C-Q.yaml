        A professional chainsaw with reduced emission engine
        technology, the STIHL MS 362 C-Q is engineered to
        save you time and money. Fuel efficiency is improved
        by up to 20% compared to previous models. The new
        pre-separation air filtration system allows for
        fewer filter changes and longer runtimes. Saving
        time doesn&rsquo;t mean you have to reduce comfort
        &ndash; an advanced anti-vibration system allows for
        longer usability during all applications, including
        logging, thinning, arborwork and large firewood
        cutting jobs. All this, plus the added benefits of a
        STIHL Quickstop&reg; and Secondary Chain Braking
        System, makes the MS 362 C-Q the leading choice for
        professionals and serious users. As part of a new
        platform design concept, the MS 362 C-Q allows for
        quicker, more streamlined serviceability from your
        local STIHL Dealer.
