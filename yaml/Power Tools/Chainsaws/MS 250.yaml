    description: >-
        A step up from the MS 230, the MS 250 is light enough to
        move through smaller tasks like clearing or cleanup
        but packs a powerful enough punch to cut through
        small limbs and trees. A combination of features and
        a high power-to-weight ratio makes this one of the
        best homeowner chainsaws on the market.
